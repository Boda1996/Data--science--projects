# 🤖 Machine Learning Classification – Spam Detection

## 🔍 Objective
Classify messages as spam or not using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn
- CountVectorizer, LogisticRegression, Naive Bayes
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Process
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (stopwords, stemming)
- Text vectorization (bag-of-words)
- Model building: Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes
- Accuracy and confusion matrix analysis

## ✅ Results
Achieved over 90% accuracy in detecting spam messages using logistic regression.
